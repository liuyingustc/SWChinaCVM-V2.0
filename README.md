This is a newly updated reference 3-D P- and S-wave community velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle in southwest China (SWChinaCVM-V2.0), obtained by joint body and surfrace wave traveltime tomography. In this version, we used seismic data recorded at both permanent stations and dense portable arrays in southwest China (more than 1,000 in total). Benefited from the dense data coverage, the resolution of SWChinaCVM-V2.0 is highly improved than the first version (SWChinaCVM-V1.0). The horizontal resolution of both Vp and Vs models can reach up to about 20 km in the upper crust and about 40 km in the middle-lower crust.

Model Data Format: Lon Lat Dep(km) Vp(km/s) Vs(km/s)

Method: Joint inversion of body wave traveltimes and Rayleigh wave traveltime data (Fang et al., 2016, JGR; Liu et al., 2021, SRL).

We provide models with different relative depths, please choose the appropriate one according to your situation:

SWChinaCVM-2.0.txt: Depth is relative to the surface (0 km).

SWChinaCVM-2.0.txt.wrst.sea_level: Depth is relative to the mean sea level (0 km).

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Huajian Yao (hjyao@ustc.edu.cn) or Ying Liu (liuying7@ustc.edu.cn).
